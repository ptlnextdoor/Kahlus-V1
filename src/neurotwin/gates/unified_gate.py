"""Branch-aware evidence gate that blocks unsupported scientific claims.

The gate writes/reads the unified-dossier JSON schema::

    {
      "branch": "v1 | v2 | v3 | em | researchdock | stf",
      "dataset": "...",
      "split_audit_passed": true,
      "baseline_table_present": true,
      "finite_metrics": true,
      "calibration_checked": true,
      "claim_scope": "...",
      "scientific_claim_allowed": false,
      "failure_reasons": []
    }

``scientific_claim_allowed`` is True only when every required boolean is True, the
``claim_scope`` is one of the narrow synthetic/audit scopes in :data:`NARROW_CLAIM_SCOPES`,
and no extra failure reasons were supplied. Anything broader is blocked with a
human-readable reason. This is a falsification gate, not a results generator.

#: Claim scopes narrow enough to be eligible (only on a fully passing gate). Anything
#: outside this allowlist is treated as "too broad" and blocks the claim. There is no
#: scope here that permits SOTA / baseline-superiority / clinical claims by design.
#: ``synthetic_ktm_training_harness`` covers infrastructure readiness only (training runs,
#: loss decreases, checkpoint/resume, bundle writes); it never implies the model recovered
#: anything. ``synthetic_ktm_recovery`` is the stronger claim and is earned only when a trained
#: KTM actually beats strong baselines on locked held-out metrics.
