# Kahlus Findings Ledger

Durable record of every publishable finding, its data artifact, the code that produced it,
and the git tag that pins the tree at the point the finding was frozen.

Read alongside [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) (claim discipline) and
[a100-run-history.md](a100-run-history.md) (engineering-run provenance).

Rule: a finding is publishable when it clears the gate predicate
`split_disjoint AND finite AND beat_best_baseline AND controls_pass AND powered AND scoped_claim`,
**or** when it is an honest negative produced by machinery that has been validated on a
synthetic known-signal / known-null pair. Negatives count. A benchmark that only flatters
its own model is worthless.

## Findings

| ID | Finding | Verdict | Substrate / power | Headline number | Data artifact | Code | Tag |

| F3 | Peripheral/autonomic channels add no residual forecastability for sleep-state transitions | Negative (scout) | Public Sleep-EDF smoke; synthetic known/null validated | Real-data RFS not distinguishable from null; synthetic known passes, null fails | `artifacts/interoception_rfs_scout/` | `src/neurotwin/forecastability/interoception_scout.py` | `finding/interoception-rfs-scout-v1` |
| F4 | Passive complexity (LZ / permutation / multiscale entropy) does not beat a spectral baseline for wake/NREM/REM discrimination | Powered negative | Full Sleep-EDF cassette: 78 subjects, 413,828 windows, claim bootstrap (n_boot=2000) | Wake RFS -0.330 [CI -0.349, -0.313]; NREM -0.284 [-0.297, -0.271]; REM -0.161 [-0.177, -0.146]; all CIs exclude 0 on the negative side | `artifacts/passive_pci_state/` | `src/neurotwin/forecastability/passive_pci.py`, `complexity_features.py` | `finding/passive-pci-negative-v1` |
| F5 | Propofol sedation: complexity beyond spectral for awake vs sedated | Powered negative (full cohort) | OpenNeuro ds005620: **21/21 subjects** (full cohort — supersedes the earlier 12/21 disk-limited partial run), 2527 windows, claim bootstrap (n_boot=2000) | Awake RFS −0.2072 [CI −0.3084, −0.1208]; sedated −0.2072 [CI −0.3077, −0.1198]; CIs exclude 0 on the negative side | `artifacts/propofol_pci_state/` | `propofol_pci.py` | `finding/propofol-pci-powered-negative-v1` |

## What the findings jointly say

Every real-data residual-forecastability probe run so far is a **negative**, produced by
machinery that is provably alive (synthetic known-signal fixtures pass, known-null fixtures
fail, controls collapse). This is itself a defensible thesis:

> Under strict subject-held-out evaluation with the best trivial baseline in the ladder,
> the residual forecastability claims that dominate the noninvasive-neural literature do not
> reproduce. The overlap illusion (F1) shows one common mechanism by which they appear to.

The arena (F0) is the asset. The negatives (F1-F4) are the evidence that the arena bites.

## Claim boundaries (do not cross)

- No clinical seizure/diagnosis claim; no consciousness claim; no "beat PCI" claim (F4 is a negative).
- The 3.116 MSE / 0.972 r number is retired as a forecasting result (F1).
- Passive PCI (F4) is a negative on Sleep-EDF cassette only; F5 tests propofol (ds005620).
- F5 claim scope must not imply TMS-PCI replacement or clinical anesthesia monitoring.
